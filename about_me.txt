I am passionate about Frontend development because it allows me to blend creativity with technology, it also allows creating visually appealing and interactive websites.And i so much enjoy doing that.
 My goal is to build user-friendly experiences and gain skills in HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.Eventually, I hope to expand into UI/UX design and expand into full-stack development.
